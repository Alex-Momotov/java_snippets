    Basics
Extension mechanism allows including packages to applications without specifying class path.
Packages added via the mechanism are available to any java application running on that platform.
This is similar to how we don't need to set class path for core java libraries.

    Installed Extensions
Installed extensions means jars that are put in specific directories that are searched for extensions.
System property System.getProperty("java.ext.dirs") refers to the list of searched directories.

For example:
.../jdk/jre/lib/ext/                    Any java application run from that jre.
~/Library/Java/Extensions/              Any java application run my the user.
/Library/Java/Extensions/               Any java application run on the platform.

    Downloaded Extensions
Downloaded extensions are jar files specified under Class-Path in the manifest of some jar file.
It's just a fancy name for them.

    Extension Search Priority
When trying to find a class by name, java searches the following places in this order.
When a class is found, it stops searching down the list and uses that class.
Hence, ensure class names in installed extensions dont hide those in class path.|
    1. Bootstrap classes - the runtime classes in rt.jar, internationalization classes in i18n.jar and others.
    2. Installed extensions
    3. Class path
